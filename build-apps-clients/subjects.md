Subjects—individual or team—are identities who take actions. An individual can create a team, which is composed of individuals who act on behalf of the team. Subjects can also create objects, blocks, or links.



A subject is created via an onchain attestation. Individuals and teams receive unique identifiers, OTTP ID and ORG ID, respectively.&#x20;
