# Build Protocol

### Contribute to OTTP

The center of discussion will be on the Farcaster channel: [/ottp](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/ottp)

Here you can contribute ideas, code, design, etc. in a social setting. This is the best way to start the conversion, but if you prefer, you can fill out this [quick form](https://tally.so/popup/n06850) instead, and we can try to plug you in another way.

For those who want to contribute through GitHub.
